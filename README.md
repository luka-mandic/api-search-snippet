## API data search and storing - snippet

A short snippet that showcases how we received offer data for certain *products* from another teams API. 

Offer data: a certain *product* (Iphone, Laptop, Tablet...) had multiple offers from multiple stores. We gave CRUD functionality for the *products* to our content managers through a plugin in OctoberCMS, and they could add certain offers to these *products*.

The *products* had to be synced between two data stores (don't ask why).
